    <h1>Brenda Seiler</h1>
    <h2>Marketing + Event Execution Support</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a marketing and events professional who thrives in deadline-driven, fast-paced environments with shifting priorities. I lead the development and execution of integrated strategies that align teams, streamline operations, and deliver measurable results. From campaign planning and digital transformation to tradeshow logistics and vendor management, I bring structure to complex projects while managing budgets, timelines, and stakeholder expectations. Iâ€™ve worked cross-functionally with sales, design, and executive teams to eliminate inefficiencies, reduce costs, and modernize marketing approachesâ€”adding digital channels long before they became standard. I create clarity, drive momentum, and help teams perform at their best under pressure.</p>
